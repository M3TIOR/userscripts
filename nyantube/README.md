Ever wanted the pastry mow as a replacement video progress bar on Youtube?
I didn't but now I have it. And so can you!

Simply add it to your Userscript Engine!

Initially I saw a Facebook post by my friend advertising a Chrome Browser
extension to do the exact same thing and I though to myself:
> Hmm, why is this a thing? Does the developer actually like Nyan Cat?
> Did they make it just for Ad revenue?

I know the Google Chrome App Store has a policy and review system for
preventing users from posting malware. But I've also caught my mother's computer
with over 4 malware Chrome Apps installed in it. The most ridiculous bit about
that whole predicament was that ***Chrome actively labeled the installed
extensions as malware in the Extension Manager but did nothing to stop them
from running on the victim's computer...*** So I figured what better way to
get malware on people's computers than by doing what most Black Hats do best:
*Abuse social engineering.*

The two most vulnerable groups in society are
the Youth and the Elderly at present. This seemed to be targeted more towards
the Youth so I downloaded it, and explored around a little bit. Lucky for me
all Chrome Apps are in Javascript, which means they're at least a little
human readable even when Minified. I didn't find any malware, but the source
Chrome App found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nyan-cat-progress-bar-for/bdjaekjkckpdknkfncfnaibkabdcgmkg?hl=en) is riddled with Ads. Meaning that code
is intrusive and it slows down the client's computer.

Not to say people shouldn't be payed for their own original ideas or things that
contribute to society. I don't believe capitalizing on the Youth who are
far more likely to think they need to purchase things from the advertisements they're
being forced to see is fair to them or their parents.

The chrome app had a far larger than necessary Nyan Cat gif which I had my friend
Toby remake from scratch to be over 2000% smaller, and it used old CSS directives
that while still maintained are no longer standard. Now it's super cross-platform
supporting Firefox, Safari, Chromium (Google Chrome, Android Browser, Edge...), and
Solaris. The smaller GIF size and newer Javascript syntax I introduced improve it's
execution and load times by over 10x. Plus I didn't put Ads in mine. So have at it!

*With much love~*
