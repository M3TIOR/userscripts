# MONSTERKITTEN

Turn that fat cat into your baby, with a this little script I whipped up.
All it does is add download buttons to all the songs on the https://monstercat.com/browse page.
I hope it's to your liking.

I wasn't actually planning to release this to the public until it was complete.
But since I considered that I usually don't finish much I start, metadata assurance was making this a little too annoying to work on; and the fact my friend was pushing me, I've finally decided to publish
this little kitty to the open web. I hope you play nice now.

Kitten's still got a little growing up to do, here are their next milestones:
 * Button to download zipped albums
 * Button to download zipped pages

They just went in for a grooming here not to recently so if you wish to inspect
the source you'll find their coat a bit less tangled.

***And if any devs from monstercat find out I'm sure they'll steal their kitty back away from us.***
So please, don't ruin the free kitty petting parade.

**Don't forget to support the artists if you have the change!**

*Sincerely with Love,*
