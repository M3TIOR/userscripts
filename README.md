# Userscripts

This repository is here to host all the Tampermonkey / Greasemonkey userscripts
I've written. Each userscript contained here is licensed under an MIT license
independently to make the licensing more portable since each userscript needs
to be distributable without any external files. The only pieces of code the
GPL-2.0 apply to are the snippits of code I used for configuring my publishing
environment within the repo IE: userscripts.py and other files in .src.

### Currently:

 * I'm working on gmailbgify and it's on hiatus.

 * Monsterkitten has been finished was sitting in my gists for ages
   Since it's older it may not be as cuddly or listen any more (not work).
   Please submit an issue if it does not work for you. That would be very
   helpful.

I don't currently plan on returning to this project very soon as I have a ton
of projects on backlog and I need to attend to the more urgent ones before I can
work my way back to this one. Please be patient as I will eventually get to it.

Much love,
Ruby Allison Rose @M3TIOR
