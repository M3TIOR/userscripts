# Userscripts

This repository is here to host all the Tampermonkey / Greasemonkey userscripts
I've written. Each userscript contained here is licensed under an MIT license
independently.

### Currently:

 * Working on other projects!

I don't currently plan on returning to this project very soon as I have a ton
of projects on backlog and I need to attend to the more urgent ones before I can
work my way back to this one. Please be patient as I will eventually get to it.

Much love,
Ruby Allison Rose @M3TIOR
